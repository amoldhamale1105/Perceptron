# Perceptron
A simple perceptron built in python to visualise linear regression in supervised learning model

## Build instructions
Install the numpy and matplotlib library with the pip3 installer  
Run the program with ```python3 ./logsiticRegression.py```

## Output
Visual of a line adjusting itself to correctly classify the given dataset of red and blue points  
The red points can be considered as labelled data of diabetic patients and blue points as healthy ones  
Using gradient descent the line tries to classify the data with nominal error  
The console prints the cross entropy error as the line adjusts itself with gradient descent
